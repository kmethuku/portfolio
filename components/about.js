        <h2>Hey! I'm Kiran.</h2>
        <div>
        I'm a web developer who enjoys the challenge of finding elegant solutions to complex problems.
        </div>
        <div>
        I approach development with a product manager mindset, leveraging user insights to generate
        opportunities and requirements for new features. Taking a user-first approach, I build
        applications that are easy to use and intuitive to navigate. Most importantly, I believe
        in delivering value continuously by shipping fast, quality code 🚀.
        </div>
        <div>
        On top of my technical skills, I have experience in customer/market research, project management,
        and client relations. I believe the best engineers are multidisciplinary and can think beyond the code.
        </div>
        <div>
        When I'm not programming, I enjoy reading and baking (I make the world's best sugar-free chocolate
        chip cookies, guaranteed 🍪). Some of my favorite books include Ender's Game and The Graveyard Book.
