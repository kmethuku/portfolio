        <h2>Hey! I'm Kiran.</h2>
        <div>
        I'm a web developer with a user-driven mindset.
        </div>
        <div>
        I design and build applications that are engaging and intuitive to navigate.
        Most importantly, I believe in delivering value continuously by shipping fast,
        quality code 🚀.
        </div>
        <div>
        I believe the best engineers are multidisciplinary. On top of my technical skills,
        I have experience in market research, project management, and client relations and
        have managed multinational market research projects. Armed with thorough, actionable
        research findings, my team's Fortune 500 clients have been able to confidently launch
        products around the world.
        </div>
        <div>
        When I'm not programming, I enjoy baking (I make the world's best sugar-free chocolate
        chip cookies, guaranteed 🍪) and reading. Some of my favorite books include Ender's
        Game and The Graveyard Book.
