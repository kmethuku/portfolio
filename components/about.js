        <h2>Hey! I'm Kiran.</h2>
        <div>
        I'm a web developer who enjoys the challenge of finding elegant solutions
        to complex problems.
        </div>
        <div>
        I develop with a user-first approach, building applications that are easy
        to use and intuitive to navigate. I believe in delivering value continuously
        by shipping fast, quality code 🚀.
        </div>
        <div>
        I have experience in customer/market research, project management, and client
        relations. Above all, I'm excited about vertical progress and building the future.
        </div>
        <div>
        When I'm not programming, I enjoy reading and baking (I make the world's best
        sugar-free chocolate chip cookies, guaranteed 🍪). Some of my favorite books include
        Ender's Game and The Graveyard Book.
